# hello-world
This is **Jayavel S**, a management graduate who likes to self host applications. You can visit [my website](https://www.jshree.tech) to learn more about what I do. I also happen to have an [Instagram Profile](https://instagram.com/jshree.tech), where I ocassionally post about some best applications and why we need to use them. I created this Github page to share the stacks that I use to host Docker applications and other stuff.
